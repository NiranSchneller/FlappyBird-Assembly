Hello and Welcome to Flappy Bird: Assembly Edition!

This project uses DOSBOX, an ms-dos emulator.

Just in case it wasn't obvious, run game.asm.

Once you have dosbox installed, change the cycles to 2000 in the settings file.

Feel free to change constants at the top of game.asm, although changing some of them will probably break the game.

Enjoy!
